# pascal-case-types

Requires class, interface, type alias, and enum declaration names to match
`/^[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*$/` — an uppercase first letter and no underscores.

## Why

TypeScript puts types and values in separate namespaces but writes them with the
same identifier syntax. At a use site, `const x: user_profile = load();` gives
the reader nothing to distinguish the annotation from a variable that happens to
appear after a colon, and `payload_type.parse(input)` could be a class, a module
object, or a plain record. Casing is the only cue available without opening the
declaration. Reserving PascalCase for things that name a type, and leaving
`camelCase` to values and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` to constants, makes that cue
mechanical: the shape of the identifier tells you which namespace it came from,
so you never have to resolve it to find out.

## Examples

```ts
// BAD
type user_profile = { id: string };
interface http_response {
  status: number;
}
class dataStore {}

// GOOD
type UserProfile = { id: string };
interface HttpResponse {
  status: number;
}
class DataStore {}
```

## Notes

- Anonymous class expressions are skipped — `export default class {}` has no
  `id` to check.
- Class expressions with a name are checked: `const C = class my_class {};`
  fires on `my_class`.
- Underscores are rejected anywhere in the name, not only at the start.
  `User_Profile` fires even though it begins uppercase.
- A leading digit or lowercase letter fires; digits elsewhere are fine, so
  `Base64Encoder` and `Http2Stream` pass.
- Enum names are checked here even though [`no-enum`](no-enum.md) rejects `enum`
  outright. The overlap is deliberate: the two rules are separately excludable,
  so someone can enable the `naming` preset while excluding
  `explicit-naming/no-enum` and keep enums. When they do, those enum names
  should still be PascalCase.
- Only declaration names are checked. Uses of a badly-named type imported from
  another module are not reported — there is no cross-file resolution.
- Type parameters, variables, functions, and properties are out of scope. Deno's
  built-in `camelcase` rule covers the value side.
