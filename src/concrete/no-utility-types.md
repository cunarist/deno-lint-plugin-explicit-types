# no-utility-types

Rejects the 22 built-in TypeScript utility types — `Partial`, `Record`,
`ReturnType`, `Omit`, and the rest.

## Why

A utility type names a transformation, not a shape. `Omit<User, "password">`
tells the reader to go find `User`, hold its fields in their head, and subtract
one. The answer is invisible at the use site and it moves: adding a field to
`User` silently changes what every `Partial<User>` and `keyof User` means, with
no diff anywhere near the code that depends on it. Writing the resulting type
out makes the shape readable where it is used, and turns a change to the
underlying type into a compile error at the places that actually care.

## Examples

```ts
// BAD
type Draft = Partial<Article>;
type Titles = Record<string, string>;

// GOOD
interface Draft {
  title: string | null;
  body: string | null;
}

type Titles = Map<string, string>;
```

## Notes

- All 22 built-ins are matched: `Awaited`, `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`,
  `Record`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Exclude`, `Extract`, `NonNullable`, `Parameters`,
  `ConstructorParameters`, `ReturnType`, `InstanceType`, `ThisParameterType`,
  `OmitThisParameter`, `ThisType`, `NoInfer`, `Uppercase`, `Lowercase`,
  `Capitalize`, `Uncapitalize`.
- Matching is by the **last** name segment, so a qualified reference like
  `ns.Partial<T>` fires too.
- Matching is by name only — there is no cross-file resolution, so a local type
  you happen to call `Record` is also reported, and a renamed import
  (`import type { Partial as P }`) is not.
- Only type positions are checked. A _value_ named `Record` — a variable, a
  function call — is untouched, because it is not a `TSTypeReference`.
- `Readonly<T>` is reported here as a utility type. The bare `readonly` keyword
  is a separate concern, and this package does not police it.
- `Deno.lint.Plugin["rules"]` is `Record<string, Rule>`, but an indexed access
  type is not a `TSTypeReference`, so it passes. That is deliberate — see the
  note on derivation in `AGENTS.md`.
