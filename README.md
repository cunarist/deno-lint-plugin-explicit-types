# deno-lint-plugin-explicit-types

TypeScript style rules for `deno lint`. Types should get written out, not
derived.

## Setup

```jsonc
// deno.json
{
  "lint": {
    "plugins": [
      "jsr:@cunarist/deno-lint-plugin-explicit-types/concrete",
      "jsr:@cunarist/deno-lint-plugin-explicit-types/naming",
      "jsr:@cunarist/deno-lint-plugin-explicit-types/absence"
    ]
  }
}
```

Three plugins, added separately. Adding one turns on every rule in it, so turn
one off by id:

```jsonc
{ "lint": { "rules": { "exclude": ["explicit-concrete/no-type-assertion"] } } }
```

Or import the rules and build your own plugin. Each entry point exports its
rules individually, plus `concreteRules`, `namingRules`, and `absenceRules` for
taking a whole set:

```ts
// lint.ts
import { concreteRules } from "jsr:@cunarist/deno-lint-plugin-explicit-types/concrete";
import { noEnum } from "jsr:@cunarist/deno-lint-plugin-explicit-types/naming";

const plugin: Deno.lint.Plugin = {
  name: "my-types",
  rules: { ...concreteRules, "no-enum": noEnum },
};

export default plugin;
```

Your diagnostics then read `my-types/no-enum`.

## `/concrete` — write the type out

A type is written, not computed. If a reader has to run the compiler in their
head to know what a value is, that's a defect.

```ts
// BAD - go read TaskSnapshot and apply two transforms
type Draft = Partial<Omit<TaskSnapshot, "id">>;

// GOOD
interface Draft {
  label: string | null;
  state: TaskState | null;
}
```

| Rule                                                               | Catches                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| [`no-utility-types`](src/concrete/no-utility-types.md)             | `Partial`, `Record`, `ReturnType`, 19 more    |
| [`no-keyof`](src/concrete/no-keyof.md)                             | A union nobody wrote down                     |
| [`no-typeof-type`](src/concrete/no-typeof-type.md)                 | A type read backwards out of a value          |
| [`no-mapped-types`](src/concrete/no-mapped-types.md)               | `{ [K in Keys]: T }`                          |
| [`no-index-signatures`](src/concrete/no-index-signatures.md)       | `{ [key: string]: T }`, where every read lies |
| [`no-inline-object-types`](src/concrete/no-inline-object-types.md) | `{ a: string }` with no name                  |
| [`no-conditional-types`](src/concrete/no-conditional-types.md)     | `T extends U ? A : B`, and `infer`            |
| [`require-return-type`](src/concrete/require-return-type.md)       | A function whose contract is in its body      |
| [`no-type-assertion`](src/concrete/no-type-assertion.md)           | `x as T`, overruling the compiler             |

`as const` and `satisfies` are allowed — both narrow rather than overrule.
Indexed access is too: `Options["retries"]` is how you name a type a library
already wrote.

## `/naming` — names carry the contract

```ts
// BAD
enum Status {
  Pending,
  Done,
}

// GOOD
type Status = "PENDING" | "DONE";
```

| Rule                                                                     | Catches                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| [`pascal-case-types`](src/naming/pascal-case-types.md)                   | A type name that isn't PascalCase  |
| [`upper-snake-string-unions`](src/naming/upper-snake-string-unions.md)   | `"pending"` where `"PENDING"` fits |
| [`no-upper-snake-object-keys`](src/naming/no-upper-snake-object-keys.md) | A union used as object keys        |
| [`no-enum`](src/naming/no-enum.md)                                       | `enum`, including `const enum`     |

These interlock: `no-enum` removes the construct, `upper-snake-string-unions`
governs the union that replaces it, and `no-upper-snake-object-keys` keeps those
members out of object keys. So turning a `Status` into a value is a `switch`,
not an object you index into — and a `switch` stops compiling the day someone
adds a member.

## `/absence` — absence is authored

`undefined` is what the language hands back when nobody said anything. `null` is
what somebody wrote. Give absence one spelling per position, and never two at
once. `?` is a good spelling — these rules keep it, they just stop it doubling
up with the `undefined` keyword or with `| null`.

```ts
// BAD
interface StoredSettings {
  apiKey?: string | null; // no-optional-null - two ways to be empty
  zoomLevel: number | undefined; // no-undefined-type
}

// GOOD - `?` on a member, `| null` where `?` cannot go
interface StoredSettings {
  apiKey?: string;
  zoomLevel: number | null;
}
```

| Rule                                                    | Catches                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [`no-undefined-type`](src/absence/no-undefined-type.md) | The `undefined` keyword in any type    |
| [`no-optional-null`](src/absence/no-optional-null.md)   | `a?: T \| null`, two ways to say empty |

`?` is the undefined type, so there is no reason to write the keyword as well.
And a value that can be empty in two ways has no definite empty value. A member
or parameter says absence with `?`; a return type or variable, which cannot take
`?`, says it with `| null`; nothing says it twice:

```ts
interface Job {
  cursor?: string;
} // GOOD
function render(host?: Element): void {} // GOOD
function findNote(id: string): Note | null {} // GOOD

function open(path?: string | null): void {} // BAD - pick one
function open(path?: string | undefined): void {} // BAD - `?` already said it
```

One caveat before adopting: a key missing from JSON is `undefined` at runtime,
not `null`, so returning `| null` means normalising where you parse data.

## How opinionated is this?

Mainstream: `pascal-case-types`, `no-enum`, `no-type-assertion`,
`no-index-signatures`.

Deliberately stronger than most TypeScript codebases: `no-utility-types`,
`no-keyof`, `no-mapped-types`, `no-typeof-type`, `no-conditional-types`,
`no-inline-object-types`. These push toward types that are declared rather than
computed — closer to writing every struct out, as Go does. What you read is what
the type is.

Strongest of all: `/absence`. It is the only preset that changes runtime code
rather than annotations.

## Pairs well with

`no-explicit-any` and `no-non-null-assertion`, both built into Deno. This plugin
leaves them alone rather than duplicating them.

## Known limits

- **No rule options.** Deno's plugin API cannot configure a rule.
- **One file at a time.** No cross-file resolution, so `no-utility-types` sees
  `Partial<T>` where it is written but not through a local alias.
- **Syntax, not types.** `no-type-assertion` sees `x as T`, not an assertion
  laundered through a function signature.
- **Names you didn't choose are left alone.** `no-upper-snake-object-keys` only
  reports UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, so custom element tags, `data-*` attributes, HTTP
  headers and library keymaps pass. Unquoted `snake_case` is Deno's built-in
  `camelcase` rule's job.
